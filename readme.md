# RI Outdoor Recreation Areas

This is an experimental version of the [GoRI's](https://github.com/401ode/GetOutdoorsRI) "Explore" page displaying SCORP (State Comprehensive Outdoor Recration Plan) data. 

This site uses a Google Spreadsheet to hold all the data and it is connected to this website using the goodies in [sheetsee.js](http://www.github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js). Everytime you visit the website, you'll have the most up to date data that has been entered into the spreadsheet. GitHub gives free hosting for every repository (see [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com)).
